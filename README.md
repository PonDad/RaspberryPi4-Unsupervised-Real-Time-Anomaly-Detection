## How it works

This app is using Hierarchical Temporal Memory.I used the sample application in the following paper.

[Unsupervised Real-Time Anomaly Detection for Streaming Data](https://numenta.com/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/unsupervised-real-time-anomaly-detection-for-streaming-data/)

## Requierment

- [htm.core](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core) 
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) 
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

64-bit OS is required to use the HTM system.

[Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit) beta test version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=275370)

There is one problem with using a 64-bit OS on a Raspberry Pi: :fire:CPU temperature is as high as 70 to 80 degrees.Fan is a must!
